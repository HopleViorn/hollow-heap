x -> 0.125x:
 - Using an array instead of a map

y -> :
 - Allocate array only once (rankmap)
 - Fewer stack copies (expand_rankmap)
 - Vector instead of std::queue
 - No safety check (decrease-key: new key < old key)
 - Inline add_child
 - Loop in the opposite direction (essentially set root as element with max rank)
